// Importing the launcher executes it: the `prepare` hook is a two-line
// delegation to `runPrepareMergeDriver`, so loading this module IS running the
// hook. Absence of `pm` on `PATH` is a supported production-install state that
// the canonical installer turns into exit code 0, and a present `pm` that
// installs the drivers cleanly also returns 0 - so in every supported
// environment the import leaves `process.exitCode` at 0, and only a genuinely
// broken CLI (a failed `pm merge install`) fails the test loudly.
